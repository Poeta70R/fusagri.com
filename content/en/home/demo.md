On [World Food Day](http://www.fao.org/world-food-day/home/en/) on 16 October 2019, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for a Food Systems Summit to be held in 2021. The Summit will provide an opportunity to unleash ambitious new actions, innovative solutions, and plans to transform our food systems and leverage these shifts to deliver progress across all 17 [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://www.un.org/en/food-systems-summit/sdgs)

The term “food system” encompasses every person and every process involved in growing, raising or making food, and getting it into your stomach – from farmers to fruit pickers to supermarket cashiers, or from flour mills to refrigerated trucks to neighbourhood composting facilities. Billions of people make a living in the world’s food systems.
